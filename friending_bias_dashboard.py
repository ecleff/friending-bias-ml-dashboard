st.header('Purpose')
st.markdown("This project investigates variables predicting friending bias to support future research optimizing rezoning for friendships, as opposed to or in addition to diversity. The end goal of rezoning school districts to optimize for diversity is to increase opportunities for all students through providing more avenues for students to increase their social capital. That only happens if diverse student groups are genuinely forming connections with one another.")
st.markdown("Before running rezoning for friending bias however, we wanted to confirm if friending bias could be taken as given for a school/district/block, or if there were demographic characteristics that directly predicted friending bias on the school level.")
st.header('What is friending bias?')
st.markdown("Friending bias is defined as 'the likelihood that low-income people form friendships with the high-income (above-median) income people that they're exposed to.' Friending bias is derived from Raj Chetty et al's Opportunity Index report, which draws from privacy-protected data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook.")
st.markdown("In context: A school with an average friending bias closer to -1 means that people at that school have a lower friending bias, meaning that the low-income students are more likely to form friendships with the high-income students they're exposed to.")
st.markdown("Likewise, a school with a friending bias closer to 1 means that people at that school have a higher friending bias, meaning these cross-SES friendships are less likely to occur.")

st.header("Findings")
st.markdown("We found that random forest and SVM regression were the models that yielded the highest predictive power. However, even these R-squared values were <0.4, and we concluded that they were not sufficient to strongly predict friending bias and therefore, friending bias should be taken as given for future rezoning purposes.")
st.markdown("For the SVM regressor, clustering and parental education attainment were the features of highest importance. For random forest, the most important features were clustering, volunteering rates, and the population of white students at the school. Below, users can explore variable feature importances for the random forest model in different data contexts.")

st.header('Data')
st.markdown("To begin to analyze factors predicting friending bias in U.S. public schools, we identified demographic features on the block and block-group level that pertain to student outcomes, in addition to the block level demographic information from the social capital dataset. The added Census data includes variables taken from the Chicago Public School's SES diversity criteria, including (1) median family income, (2) adult educational attainment, (3) the percentage of single-family households, (4) home-ownership percentage, & (5) percentage of population that speaks a language other than English. Other Census variables were included to supplement the definition of socioeconomic diversity, including public assistance status, median gross rent as a percentage of household income, average commute time for household head, and poverty-income ratio. Data files can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dDoTyjGl5AHuoaCb591WGle2Mz-MvULF?usp=sharing.")
